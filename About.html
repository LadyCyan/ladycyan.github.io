      <p id = "about">
        Hello! My name is Taylor and I'm a Gaming Interactive Media Mobile major. I graduate with my Bachelor's Degree on May 8th, 2021 from Boise State University. I am most interested in story design or marketing for video games, and my favorite genre is horror games! The game that inspired me to get into this major is Resident Evil 4. Some of the games that I spend a lot of time playing are Hunt: Showdown, Apex Legends, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege, and Loop Hero!

      <h1 id="experience">Experience</h1>
      <p>I am currently in my senior year of the GIMM program and am in the process of constructing an individual VR game. I have constructed many other games, most of which were team projects. I have the experience of storyboarding and animating a music video, as well as writing a sound walk. I have also made two websites, this website itself and another team website. Most of these things will be mentioned throughout this site, so check them out if you haven't!</p>
