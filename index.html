        Hello! My name is Taylor and I'm a Gaming Interactive Media Mobile major. I am most interested in story design for video games, and my favorite genre is horror games! The game that inspired me to get into design is Resident Evil 4. I am interested in making a 2D puzzle, horror, survival game within the next year or year and a half using RPG maker. I spend most of my time playing Tom Clancy's: Rainbow Six Siege!

      <h1 id="experience">Experience</h1>
      <p>I am currently in my second year of the GIMM program and am starting the process of constructing an individual game. I have constructed two other games, both were team projects. I have the experience of storyboarding and animating a music video, as well as writing a sound walk. I have also made two websites, this website itself and another team website. All of these things will be on this website and available for your viewing!</p>
