    <h1>Unfortunately, I don't have access at the moment to my old games, so I will summarize them and the techniques I used.</h1>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    <h1 id="daycare">Alien Daycare</h1>
    <p>The object of the game was to take care of alien babies. The three different types of babies were: one that was always hungry, one that was always angry, and one that was always needing to go to the bathroom. This was the first group game I worked on! When the aliens had a problem, you clicked and dragged them to the specified area. The areas were the bathroom, time-out for the angry one, the kitchen for the hungry one, and if the angry one hurt one of the other ones, you had a med-bay where they could get patched up. This was our main experience with random activity and a.i. interaction in certain areas.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <h1 id="castle">Protect the Castle!</h1>
    <p>Protect the Castle was the first game I ever made and my first experience with coding. The player controlled a ballista that sat on top of a castle parapet and shot an incoming wave of alien bugs. There were two types of enemies, smaller ones that moved slower, and bigger ones that moved faster. Every ten points the player got a barrage to use on the incoming waves and over time they multiplied. It was a really simple game design, a 2D shooter, but I was really proud of the outcome after only using the code for the first time!</p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    <h1 id="torched">Torched</h1>
    <p>Torched is my first experience with coding in C++ and using Unreal Engine. I worked on this project with 4 others. I was lead coder, and responsible for the aura effect and getting the fire particle system to trigger using blueprints. Below is a Youtube video showcasing the short game we were tasked to make in a month.</p>
